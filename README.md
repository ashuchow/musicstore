MuzikMart is an ecommerce website for musical instruments. The site opens on to a home page which has on it a navigation bar with all the other pages you can go to. In the footer, we have all the contact details for the page which is visible on all of the pages. The Products page contains the database of all the instruments you can buy on the site. Here, there are filters for colour as well as dexterity which help you specify the product. In addition to this we have a search bar that allows you to locate the item you desire. 
In order to access some of the features on the page, you need to create an account and login. Here you can use your email to create an account locally or use the google authenticate feature to create an account. After this, you use the login page to enter your profile. After logging in you can avail the cart and wishlist features on the page which store products particular to each user. On purchasing each item, you are given a confirmation message and the bought products show up on the user profile page.
For the site, we used the MERN stack, connecting to a mongodb atlas cluster using mongoose. We have used Express, node and MongoDb for the backend and created a React App and used AXIOS for the frontend. We have used passport to implement google nd local authorisation strategies and our routes provide the application the abilities to add and delete items to the wishlist and cart as well as reviews to products. The coding languages we used were javascript and JSX and a lot of the styling was done on CSS but also using the ‘style’ feature within the code. Some of the resources we used are as follows:
